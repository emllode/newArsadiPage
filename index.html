        <h2><span>About us</span> </h2>

        <p>ARSADI is a Swedish pop group formed in 2016 by Anthony Bachtiar on vocals and keyboard, 
            Feria Hikmet and Nils Öberg on guitar and bass, and Pedram Effati on drums. The, 
            nowadays, former students from the university town Uppsala try to push their pop songs in new and exciting directions. 
            Both Swedish and international reviewers have noted this and gisven both the debut-EP Vivid Colours and each single very positive feedback. 
            The much-appreciated releases have resulted in interviews for various Swedish magazines and several live performances in different radio stations.
             The pop group released their latest single If You Were Mine on the 6th of March, 
             produced by Kenneth Eriksson and mastered by Martin Ankelius.</p> 
             
        <p>ARSADI made their live debut only a month after forming the band and has played a lot ever since.
            At their latest live show at Emergenza Stockholm, ARSADI provided a lively cavalcade of dance hits,
             impossible to stand still to. In their hometown Uppsala, they are regularly giving energetic performances
              at sold-out student societies and as a three-time headliner at the biggest stage at the annual culture festival. 
              They’ve also played at the famous stage of Katalin where most national and international artists visiting Uppsala
               have played. However, ARSADI can also play softly at intimate and scaled-down gigs such as for Sofar Sounds.
                With their big love for playing live, they embrace their audience with a steady rhythm, warm vocals and sharp guitar
                 solos and convey their music with playfulness, precision and heart.</p>
